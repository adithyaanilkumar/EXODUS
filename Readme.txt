Decentralized Item Delivery Network

The project aims to build and develop a decentralized Item delivery and logistics network.

The prices are set according to a bidding model where the customers can bid against the driver for a lower a price.

If a person is travelling from suppose a point A to B and suppoose another person wants to send something from C to D in between and on the way between A and B, then he can use Exodus network to send the package.

The system avoids a middle man and hence is more safe and secure. there is also a KYC check in place that will hensure that the packages are not stolen.
